Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a software engineer who loves to build cool things and solve problems. I've been tinkering with code for as long as I can remember - I taught myself Python when I was just 13 years old and since then there's been no looking back! I'm a huge Linux fan, and I've tried out all sorts of distros - yes, even Arch. Whenever I get the chance, I spend some time answering questions on forums and contributing to open-source projects

I also happen to be a pianist! Music has been a big part of my life, and I've been playing I was six years old. I even teach and professionally sometimes. I enjoy playing and listening to all sorts of styles. But jazz and reggae are probably my favourite. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me at the piano, improvising what I'm feeling into a melody.

In my career as a software engineer, I've had the chance to work on some pretty exciting projects. I've built ecommerce and logistics systems that have integrated with some of the biggest providers in India - Shopify, Delhivery, Amazon, Woocommerce, you name it! I also like building developer tools and love playing with data (I might switch to a more data focused role soon)

So that's a little bit about me. I hope you enjoy exploring my website, this is where I'm showcasing my work - everything from software engineering to music. I hope you find something here that inspires you. Thanks for stopping by!

PS: Currently, I'm on the lookout for new opportunities to explore new challenges and apply my talents. If you're interested in chatting more or have a job opportunity you'd like to discuss, feel free to drop me an email at [juliusalphonso.09@gmail.com](mailto:juliusalphonso.09@gmail.com).
